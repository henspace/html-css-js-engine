This little game is a rehash of what I think was a very old Amstrad PC1512 game. I've trawled all the Amstrad
games I can find on the web, but I haven't found anything close. Bridge-It comes up as a suggestion when I search, 
but that was a pseudo 3D game. The game I remember involved a procession of little characters walking from left to
right along a very tall bridge. I can still visualise the little guys walking across my monochrome monitor and falling
into gaps in the bridge. Perhaps I just dreamt it! Perhaps it was one of those freebies that appeared in a
magazine. Who knows? 

Anyway, if it did exist and it's not a figment of my imagination, here's my version moved into space. The original
Amstrad monitor was black and white, but I've gone with green on black as it just feels older.
