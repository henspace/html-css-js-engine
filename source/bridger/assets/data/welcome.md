# Welcome to Bridge over Jupiter

Your job is to get the astronauts across a band of meteors by moving the space platform.

+ If using a keyboard, use the A, D or arrow keys to move the platform.
+ If using a touchscreen, tap and hold the left or right side of the screen.

Good luck!

Select your spacemen's walking speed: slow, normal or fast.
