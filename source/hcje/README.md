# The HTML-CSS-JS Engine (HCJE)

The HCJE is a very simple set of utilities designed to help with the creation of apps that use vanilla JavaScript.
The philosophy behind the engine is to avoid any dependencies on third-party libraries in the developed app.
In addition, the build process, which runs under Node.js, also avoids any additional dependencies, with the exception
of **Jsdoc**, which is used to generate the documentation.
