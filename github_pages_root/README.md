# HTML-CSS-JavaScript-Engine (HCJE)

This is the launch page for the HTML-CSS-JavaScript Engine or HCJE. 

The engine itself is designed to help with the creation of simple games that do not use a canvas element. It's more of a
test tool than a full blown engine, but you might find some interesting bits in it. 

## Documentation

Documentation for the engine and associated build tools can be found below. This documentation is far from complete.
